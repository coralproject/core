## Caching layer (per publisher)

The idea is to have a 'caching layer' that gets the data we need from the newsroom's systems.
We are going to have several strategies to do the translation/mapping from their systems to our own.

### NY Times Strategy

type: user, item, boolAction, associationAction, externalReference

Schema
```{
  database: nyt,

  "article": {
    type: externalReference,
